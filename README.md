# Note Taker Starter Code

Application can be used to write and save notes. Using Express.js for the back end, it will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

Source code from [miniature-eureka](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/miniature-eureka)
My job was to build the back end and then connect to the application's already existing front end. After the back and front ends are connected, the application will be deployed to Heroku.
