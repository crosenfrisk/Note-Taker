  ## Description
  **takeNote** is an application that can be used to write and save notes. This application uses an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

  My job was to build the back end of the application and then connect to the application's already existing front end. See [Credits](#Credits) for details.

  ## Installation
  The user may visit the [site deployed on Heroku](https://git.heroku.com/take-note-01.git) to use from their web browser, or they may download a copy of this repository and open from within their own editor.


  ## Usage

  From the landing page in the browsers, users should click `Get Started` to enter takeNote. From the notes page, users can enter a title for the note, then add text for the note.

  After adding text, a save icon will appear in the upper right corner. After clicking it, the new note will be saved to the left sidebar. Saved notes will appear with a red trash icon which can be clicked to remove from the sidebar. 
  
  Users can click the note from the sidebar to see it enlarged again in the center pane. *Currently Notes cannot be edited*

  ![Viewing Saved Notes](public/assets/images/AddingMoreNotes.png)
  
  To add a new note after viewing an old note, click the `+` icon in the upper right. To be redirected to the landing page, click `takeNote` in the upper left corner.

  ![Deleting and Adding New Notes](public/assets/images/DeletingAddingNotes.png)
  As you can see, deleting a note not only removes it from the sidebar, it also removes it permanently from the database, shown here as `db/db.json` on the right side of the picture.

  Thank you for using!
